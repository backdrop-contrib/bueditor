BUEditor
========

A plain textarea editor aiming to facilitate code writing.
It's the most flexible text editor of the web because it allows you to;
 - build the editor from scratch.
 - determine the functionality by defining image or text buttons that generate 
 code snippets, html tags, BBCode tags etc.
 - determine the design and layout by defining theme buttons that insert html to
 the layout.
